    Task 1: Basic Syntax and Flake8 Checker

    Python uses indentations to separate blocks instead of backets.
    Unlike most language (like C++), indentations in Python are required.

    See https://www.python-course.eu/python3_blocks.php for some examples.

    Flake8 (http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) could help you check these
    syntax error. It also regular your coding style. For example, using
    two whitespaces as indentation is allowed in Python. However, Flake8
    will tell you it is an error "E111: indentation is not a multiple of four".
    This is because when many people work on the same project, it would be
    confusing if people are using different identation style.

    Following the coding style in Flake8 is strongly suggested.

    # Hint:
    # Run `python src/autograder.py -task 1 <your student ID>`
    # to see if you pass this task.
    # The correct output would be "Hello world" without any
    # error. Note that passing this task does NOT mean you pass the
    # Flake8 chcker. Please check your style with
    # `flake8 src/student/<your student ID>.py`

    # TODO: fix the syntax error for the following code
    if true:
      print ("Hello world")

    # End of TODO (do not change the code below)
    return True
